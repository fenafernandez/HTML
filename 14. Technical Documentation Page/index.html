                        JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight language. 
                        Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment 
                        to provide programmatic control over them.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements
                         such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by 
                         supplementing it with additional objects; for example:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its Document 
                            Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML 
                            form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a 
                            server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, provide 
                            continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations 
                            on a server. 
                        </li>
                    </ul>
