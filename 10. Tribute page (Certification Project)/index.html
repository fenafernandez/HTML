                <p id="life-description">Charles Michael Schuldiner (born May 13, 1967 - December 13, 2001) was an American vocalist and guitarist. He founded the death metal band Death in 1983, in which he was the band's lead vocalist, guitarist and only consistent member until his death in 2001. 
                    His obituary in the January 5, 2002, issue of UK's Kerrang! magazine described him as "one of the most significant figures in the history of metal." Schuldiner was ranked No. 10 in Joel McIver's book "The 100 Greatest Metal Guitarists" in 2009 and No. 20 in March 2004 Guitar World's "The 100 Greatest Metal Guitarists". Schuldiner died in 2001 of a brain tumor.
                    Schuldiner is often referred to as "The Godfather of death metal", although he was uncomfortable with this nickname, remarking that "I don't think I should take the credits for this death metal stuff. I'm just a guy from a band, and I think Death is a metal band."</p>
